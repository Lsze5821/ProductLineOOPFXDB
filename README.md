# Product Line Tracker
This program is for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. 
This program was mostly created individually with assistant from TA as well as Professor.
I started this project on September 16,2019, completed the project on December 7,2019.
I created this project in class and worked on it at home, it was an assignment for Object-Oriented programming
at FGCU.

## Demonstration

## Getting Started
Make sure that JRE is installed:
* Java version "1.8.x_xx" (or a higher version)

Clone from Github:
* Click on "Clone or download".
* Either Download the Zip file or clone the HTTPS.
* If you Download the Zip
* Unzip and open project in the IDE

Clone From IDE:
* File > New > Project From version control > Enter URL/HTTP > Choose the directory for project > clone

Creating Path to Database:
* Database tab > Plus sign > Data source from path > Choose directory for database (ex: Lib Folder) > h2 > test connection > apply
* Check the database password inside the properties folder.

Linking Jar file:
* File > Project structure > Modules > Dependencies > Find and Choose jar file > apply



## Built With
* Intellij

* Scene Builder

* JavaFx GUI, Database H2, SQL

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
**Object-Oriented Programming**

* Objects: Building blocks of object-oriented. Each object is a programming unit consisting of data (instance variables) and functionality (instance methods).
* Class: A blue-print, a type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object.
* Inheritance: The concept of classes automatically containing the variables and methods defined in their supertypes.
* Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
* Abstract: Keyword used in a class definition to specify that a class is not to be instantiated, but rather inherited by other classes.
* Interface: keyword used to define a collection of method definitions and constant values. It can later be implemented by classes that define this interface with the "implements" keyword.
* Enum: A keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Legal values consist of a fixed set of constants
* Lambda Expressions: enable you to treat functionality as method argument, or code as data.
* Recursion: The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
* Implement: A keyword that is included in the class declaration to specify any interfaces that are implemented by the current class.
* Overload: Using one identifier to refer to multiple items in the same scope.
* Methods:A function defined in a class.
* Fields: A data member of a class.
* Extends: Class X extends class Y to add functionality, either by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by overriding methods of class Y.

**SQL Database**

* Insert: Insert new records in database.
* Into: Insert new records in table.
* Values: What needs to be inserted.
* Select: Select data from a database.
* From: Select data from a column.
* Asterisk: Choose ALL values.
* Update: Modify the existing records in a table.
* Set: Table to update.
* Unique: Delete existing records in a table.
* Where Clause: Specifies which record(s) that should be updated.
